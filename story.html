        <p>I was with my mum in the living room, doing our things until my mum showed me a picture of 3 kittens on a
            website. She then told me that we should adopt one of them. At first, I thought she was joking with me as
            she always does but she was not as she started talking about what to buy for him. I think a day after that,
            we went to go buy stuff for the cat and pick one of the 3 potential forever pet. When we got to someones
            house, the owner came out with 3 kittens in his arms. One was a brown cat, two were orange. I couldn't
            choose one as they were all so adorable :( In the end, I choose the odd one out, the ttangkong. And we went
            home with him in my arms.</p>
